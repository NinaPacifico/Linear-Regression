# Linear-Regression

This project focuses on data collected from an e-commerce company that sells clothing online. 
Customers can order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want. 
The company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or website.
To make this decision, we use a linear regression model that will allow us to understand what factors impact more the annual revenue.

The data frame contains data from 500 costumers and shows:
- Costumers information (email, address and avatar colour)
- The average session length
- The amount of time spent on the app
- The amount of time spent on the website
- The length of the membership
- The yearly amount spent
